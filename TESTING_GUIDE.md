## Performance Tests

---

### Test 19: Debounce Performance
**Steps:**
1. Open Network tab in Dev Tools
2. Type full pincode: `631209`
3. Count API calls: **Should be exactly 1** (not 6 for each digit)

---

## Cleanup After Testing

### Database Check
```sql
-- Verify no phone numbers contain country code prefix
SELECT phone FROM addresses 
WHERE phone LIKE '+%' 
   OR phone LIKE ' %'
   OR LENGTH(phone) > 15;
-- Should return: 0 rows

-- Verify phone column has expected format
SELECT phone FROM addresses LIMIT 5;
-- Expected: All are digit-only strings like "7358803372"
```
